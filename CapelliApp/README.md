# CapelliApp

This project is my development of a mobile app for my family's business of selling beauty/barber supplies. It will utilize a system of viewing featured and on-sale products, a payment system, and other features of a typical online-selling mobile app. This expo link can be used to see my current progress and to see the app in action as I continually work on it, however the GitHub code will be continually updated as well: https://snack.expo.dev/@adrielgenao/capelliapp. (iOS/Android view would be the most viable emulator/sample of the app instead of web view).
